# Chrome-Password-Stealer-Payload
Another payload for the DigiKeyboard rubber ducky. This one steals Chrome passwords and emails them to an email of your choosing (or a text to a phone number of your choosing).


# DISCLAIMER PLEASE READ
I DO NOT TAKE CREDIT FOR THE EXE. IT IS FROM nirsoft.com AND IS EXTREMELY HELPFUL IN THIS PAYLOAD.
DO NOT HOLD ME LIABLE IF YOU GET IN TROUBLE WITH THAT EXE OR WITH THIS PAYLOAD.
